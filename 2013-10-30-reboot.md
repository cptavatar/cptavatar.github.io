## Reboot
The internet keeps changing on me. 

I keep changing.

Just about 10 years ago, I grabbed this domain, started this site mostly so I could share what I was up to with friends and family. Perhaps I would write about something geeky now and then, but that was my main intention. Facebook hadn't escaped the universities yet, and who wanted a myspace page? It worked. 

Then Facebook took off more, it evolved into an easy way to spam a semi-controlled group of people with information.  

Also, somewhere in that time I managed to aquire a wife and a couple of kids (watch out, it could happen to you!). I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to share, with whom, and how. And I was busy, really busy. 

During this time, I've also evolved into a cranky internet citizen. I don't like it when songs disappear off my spotify playlists because, well, they not my songs and my rights to that song have been revoked. Facebook, Google - they're convenient, but their terms keep changing and at the end of the day they are busineses and do need to find ways to make money. My level of trust is not high - plus people move on. 

I want to own my data, my posts. However I don't want to worry about wordpress/mysql vulnerabilities. I want it static. Easy. To that end, you might notice some differences since I moved to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to drive my site, using [prose](http://prose.io) to help with the editing. 

I don't know where I'm going. We'll just have to see how it goes.
