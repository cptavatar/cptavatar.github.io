..for my poor [S400](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons400/). The lens got stuck halfway out after my [ocean beach backpacking trip](http://www.jasonrose.com/photos/list.php?exhibition=61) I took last summer so I finally took it apart to see if I could fix it. Blowing it out with compressed air had failed, so I thought "what do I have to lose?". I was amazed at how much sand had managed to sneak its way in given the lack of any noticeable entry point. I put it back together after blowing it out again and now it wont start up anymore - doh! Lesson learned - sand and cameras don't mix very well...  

Oh, tweaked the website design again... what do ya think? I didn't like how things were looking under windows so I tweaked some of the CSS and designed a title image really quick in photoshop.
