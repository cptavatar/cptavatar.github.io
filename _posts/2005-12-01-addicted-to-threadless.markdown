I think I have a problem. Its name is [threadless.com](http://www.threadless.com) and apparenly I can't stop buying tshirts from them every couple of months. I have to admit there are a couple of shirts that I probably wouldn't have bought if there wasn't $10 sale enthusiasm clouding my judgement but in general I'm very satisfied with the interesting designs I've picked up.
