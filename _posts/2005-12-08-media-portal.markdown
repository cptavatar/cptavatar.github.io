Back in the hight of my [WOW](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) addiction I did a budget upgrade on my PC - upgraded to amd64 3000, new socket 939 motherboard, nvidia 6600GT. I've kept this box with XP on it sitting around just in case I need windows for something which turns out to be just about never.  

I'd temporarily retired my old [VIA MythTV box](http://www.alexrose.net/archives/000009.shtml) (its bad when the power supply makes a god-awful noise right?) so I've been [relying on BitTorrent](http://isohunt.com/) lately for my TV viewing needs. Why not repurpose my perfectly good windows box and see what the state-of-the-art in open source windows [PVR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder) software is like?  

[Media Portal](http://mediaportal.sourceforge.net/) is an open source .NET based PVR solution hosted over on [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/). It has all the [standard features](http://mediaportal.sourceforge.net/features.html) and then some- timeshifted TV viewing, DVD/Video/Music playback, image gallery, even tetris.  

I have to say, the interface looks nice in my opinion. I also noticed that video looked better under windows using my [WinTV PVR-250](http://www.hauppauge.com/html/wintvpvr250_datasheet.htm) than under Linux. Setting up [XMLTV](http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/) was a little problematic since after I followed all the [instructions](http://www.maisenbachers.de/dokuw/howto:mytv:setupxmltv) I ended up with listings that were 8 hours off, but its not too hard to fix that in the set up. I wasn't too happy with the scheduling interface - browsing the guide data alphabetically is *really* slow and its missing some of the recording / storage options I'm used to in [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/).  

I have to say after using it for a couple of days I think I prefer MythTV's mature usability over MediaPortal's slick work-in-progress interface but I find it usable enough that I will continue to use it as my [PVR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder) for a while. Give it a bit more time and I'm sure some of what I think are rough edges will be ironed out.
