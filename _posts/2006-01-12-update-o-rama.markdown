Within days of my last post I was back to [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/), partly because it works better and partly since I can watch recordings [over my network on my Mac](http://www.mythtv.info/moin.cgi/MythOnMacOsx).  

Time to come clean: I succumbed and re-activated my [WOW](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/) account. < big sigh > . A lot of things have [changed](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/) since I quit and I actually having fun again. Its sad, but given how I get sucked into these games I actually set up parental controls on myself to control when I can play : )
