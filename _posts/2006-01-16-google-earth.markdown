When I heard that [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) had been [released for OS X](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/google-earth-in-mac-world-pc-too.html) the other day I had to give a spin. At first glance it looks sorta like a standalone client for their [online maps service](http://maps.google.com/), albeit with many more layers you can overlay over the map and more UI special effects.  

Dig around a bit more and you find there is a whole [user community](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/categories.php/Cat/0) around finding and labeling places on the map. You enable these optional layers and you find a treasure trove of little details people have spent time entering in. For instance in my area I find [free WI-FI access points](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Number/169233) labeled, [traffic cam information](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Number/26428), [Bruce Lee's Grave](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Number/7936), [Bill's house](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Number/62620), or where [Kurt shot himself](http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Number/53614).  

I was let down a little bit that it wouldn't handle the address for my friend in Japan, but then again none of the map sites seem to do so...
