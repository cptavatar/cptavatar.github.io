Its been over a year, but I'm working on Cerebral Imprint again.
My first goal - make it so it doesn't look like, well, ass (pardon my french). When I first started working on Cerebral Imprint I was a fresh switcher from a windows world and the only user interface work I had done in a while was [swing based](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/). Now that I've been a Mac convert for quite some time I find the user interface to be somewhat of an embarrassment. So, [what do you think](mailto:cerebral.imprint@alexrose.net) about this layout?
[![Prototype Cerebral Imprint](http://www.alexrose.net/media/img/CerebralImprint-test1.gif)](http://www.alexrose.net/media/img/CerebralImprint-test1.gif)
Its going to be a little bit before I have a new test version ready but stay tuned. My goal is to actually stabilize the code base, release a 2.0 release, then actually start to add new features again.
