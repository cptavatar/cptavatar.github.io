Have you actually seen [Axl Rose](http://www.thestranger.com/blog/archives/2006/02/19-25.php#a004445) lately? Scary, although not as scary as [Eddie Van Halen](http://news.yahoo.com/photo/060306/482/camw12703061102;_ylt=Ai2HdbOpZZNkp.K6VKQfMBIDW7oF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl).  

(Oh, and please no "Alex Rose / Axl Rose" jokes. Trust me, you are *not* the first one to make that clever lexical leap.)
