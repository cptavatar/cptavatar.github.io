A couple weeks and I'll be taking a long, long, long deserved vacation to the [land of the rising sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Japan). My good friend [Teman](http://temancl.blogspot.com/) lives in Tokyo so I'll be crashing at his pad for a while before setting out via train to see the country armed only with a travel guide, a couple of [pimsleur lessons](http://www.simonsays.com/content/index.cfm?sid=128), and the invaluable knowledge gleaned from the [Josh in Japan podcast](http://www.joshinjapan.com/). I plan on bringing my laptop with me so I'll try and post some updates while I'm gone.
