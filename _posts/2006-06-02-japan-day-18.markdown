Back to Tokyo. This morning I got up nice and early and headed down to the hotel restaurant for another Japanese breakfast. This time the fish was salmon and there were no fish ovaries, just some extra pickles and an [umeboshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umeboshi).  

One more night and I head back home. I've really liked visiting Japan, but I'm getting a little tired of living out of a suitcase, unpacking and repacking at every stop. I make my way over to the train station and pick up my express tickets to Nagoya, then head back to Teman's place in Tokyo on the shinkansen.  

After burning most of the day traveling, I head out to do some last minute gift shopping for when I go back. When Teman and Sayaka get home we head out for sushi which was great. Quality fish for not that expensive, a nice change after the so-so sushi I had in Kyoto.
