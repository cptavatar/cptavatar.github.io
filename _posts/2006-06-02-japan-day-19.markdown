Last day. I sleep in after staying out a bit too late the night before and work my way out to the airport by working my way to Shinjuku and hopping on the [Narita Express](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/index.html). Everything take a bit longer than I expect, especially once I get to the airport so I get to my gate about 5 minutes before boarding starts.  

A uneventful flight back, a quick taxi ride, and I'm home sweet home - and completely jet lagged.
