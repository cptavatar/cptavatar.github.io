Ever since I came home from Japan there's been this spider thats been hanging out right by the door to my condo. Waiting. Watching. I swear every time I see it, its a little bit bigger...

Now, I have a confession - if there is anything that has a high chance of making me scream like a little girl, its spiders. No, not little dinky spiders, not cute daddy long legs - I'm talking big, evil looking spiders.
As it is, we are at a standoff. I wait, hoping he will go away, for he is already way to big for me to be comfortable with direct action. He waits, biding his time I'm sure till he's just a little big bigger so he can accomplish whatever nefarious plot he's been weaving.
