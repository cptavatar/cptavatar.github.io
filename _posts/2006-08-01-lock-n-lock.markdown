I stumbled across some containers I just love at [Uwajimaya's](http://www.uwajimaya.com/) this week - they are 870ml with 4 removable inserts and and locking lid mechanism that works really good for ~ $4.50 a pop.

I try and be good by making my own lunches each week. I usually just do a big batch of stir fry, pasta, or what have you on the weekend and portion it up into tupperware so I can just grab-n-go in the morning. For the longest time I've wanted a bit more variety but that usually includes multiple containers that end up too big for the quantity of food I want to bring. This 4 insert system works great, although I have to definitely think smaller portion sizes since its really easy to end up with more food than space. Here's what my lunches for this week look like...
