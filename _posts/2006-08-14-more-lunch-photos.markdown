Went back to Uwajimaya and found the 3 compartment containers I was looking for. They are little more expensive but the main section is the perfect size for doing lunch-sized [donburi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donburi). For their inaugural use I tried to recreate one of my favorite meals from when I was in Japan - [unagi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unagi), train station [bento](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento) style with scrambled egg.

I've been really enjoying doing the little bit of extra cooking required to put these lunches together. I've been uploading pictures of what I make to flickr and tagging them - if you want to see what I've been making you can always see [pictures of my latest lunches here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex_rose/tags/lunch/).
