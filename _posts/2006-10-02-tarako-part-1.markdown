A couple of weeks back I stumbled across what I found to be the most mesmerizing series of japanese commercials...  

[TV In Japan page](http://tvinjapan.com/blog/2006/09/10/big-in-japan-right-now-the-tarako-cupie-girls/)  

[YouTube Commercial 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrXtSMzjhMQ&NR)  

[YouTube Commercial 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SfWlmAJLo4)  

[Kewpie Homepage](http://www.kewpie.co.jp/tarako/index.html)  

I found myself powerless to resist Kewpie's amazing marketing skills - so great are they I ended up picking up a package even though cognitively I know that cod roe spaghetti is highly unlikely to be favorable to my american palate.

Since then the package has sat on my counter, mocking my consumeristic weakness. I'm currently firming up my resolve to try it this week and see how it turns out...
