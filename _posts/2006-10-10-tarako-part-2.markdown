I awoke this morning to find a [picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/teman/265949177/in/set-72157594321344748/) my friend [Teman](http://temancl.blogspot.com/) had sent me, one of him and along with a poor individual stuffed inside a life sized Tarako Kewpie mascot outfit, and knew today was the day....

After squishing out the cod roe goop I have to say I was pretty turned off - this coming from someone who has tried [natto](http://www.flickr.com/photos/roboppy/6806781/) (and found they like it). It wasn't as strong as I thought it was going to be though, reminded me somewhat of tuna noodle casserole or something. Except with seaweed. And bits of cod roe. Too bad I don't actually care for tuna casserole.
