I am back, and this time I brought little brother Trevor with me. No problems so far, customs was a snap, and I even was able to navigate my way to Teman's place from the airport without his intervention.  

At Teman's suggestion we got in on their [N'EX/Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/suica-nex/index.html) sale where you get a discounted train ticket from the airport and a Suica card loaded with 1500 yen of credit for traveling the subways - what a great deal and very easy to use.  

Had dinner at Teman's then went to his favorite local bar where they had a DJ playing a great mix of jazz/electronica/dub/funk stuff - impressive given that the bar is literally a single bar that seats maybe 10 people tops.  

No pictures yet, just unpacked my camera. I'll post stuff to flickr as we go just like last time.
