Trevor and I have had a busy couple of days in Tokyo - Saturday we did Asakusa, Ueno Park, Akihabara, and Shibuya and finished up at the brown beer fest in Meguro. Sunday we wandered around Shinjuku, Harajuku, Omote-sando, and Yoyogi park and finished up having kieten-sushi at a nice place in Roppongi.
