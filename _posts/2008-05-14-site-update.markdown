Ok, alexrose.net is up and ready for business again. I updated to the latest version of wordpress, tweaked a simple theme to get a clean look, and imported my old content. I'm not 100% happy with how things look but I'm going to make a concerted effort to keep working at it, especially since I have a lot of plans for this summer all lined up.




Speaking of summer - its time for [SIFF](http://www.siff.net/) again already. Do you have your tickets yet? I do - going to see some [Johnny To](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0969269/), a little [Takashi Miike](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906665/) , and a really old (young?) [Jackie Chan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081499/) amongst others.
