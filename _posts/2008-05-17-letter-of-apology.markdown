Dear patron of [sushi maki](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-maki-seattle),




I know you were probably looking forward to your special tuna roll. I was looking forward to my spicy tuna roll combo with extra pieces of tamago and unagi as well. Unfortunately, they gave me your order instead and I didn't notice it until I got home. It's a ten minute walk and I was too lazy to go back so I ate your order - Sorry!  





Seriously though, for a tiny, tiny place, it was hopping on this beautiful Friday Seattle evening. The roll was huge and pretty tasty - I think I'll have to give them another chance even if I was seriously missing my real order.
