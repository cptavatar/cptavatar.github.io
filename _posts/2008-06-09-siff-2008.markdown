Well, I'm out of tickets for [SIFF](http://www.siff.net) this year. I have to say, I wasn't as excited for their lineup this year compared to previous years however most of what I saw this year turned out to be pretty good. Here were my favorites:





  
  * [Sukiyaki Western Django](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906665/)


  
  * [Mermaid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0995747/)


  
  * [Mongol](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416044/)


  
  * [The Young Master](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081499/)
