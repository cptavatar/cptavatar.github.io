Enough of this [lousy weather,](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004470095_weather11m.html) time to head off and meet [my brother](http://www.jasonrose.com/) where the weather is [warm](http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/tenday/FPXX0001?from=36hr_topnav_business). [Youngest brother](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex_rose/469218593/) and I be getting into [Papeete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papeete) around 5AM tomorrow and after meeting up with Jay and spending a couple of days seeing the city we'll be sailing off towards [Moorea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorea) and eventually up towards the [Leeward Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeward_Islands_%28Society_Islands%29). I'll try to stick up a blog entry now and then, but no promises.
