Just checking in really quick. We arrived in Papeete safe and sound, although our luggage didn't arrive until more than 15 hours later. We spent the day meeting Jason's cruising buddies, wandering the town, and checking out the local brewery.




After a rocky night in the harbor, we pulled out and headed over to Moorea. It was wet and windy sail in the largest seas I've ever been in, but then again I've never done much sailing outside of puget sound before.




Moorea has been great. Where we are moored we can swim right out to the reefs where the snorkelling is incredible. I can't believe the variety of fish I've seen, from big ol sting rays to little fish that look like tetras - its like swimming through a well stocked aquarium display. Yesterday I joined up with some of Jason's friends and went hiking up to a viewpoint where we could overlook both of the bays on this side of the island. It was a long trek even when you factor in the couple of rides we were able to hitch and the kind stranger who lent us his car (!) to get to the top, but it was well worth it.

Today we are probably going to pull anchor and head over to Huahine - its a 90 mile sail, a good deal of which we'll do overnight, so this should be interesting.
