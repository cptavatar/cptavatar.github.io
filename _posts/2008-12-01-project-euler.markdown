I stumbled across [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) the other day and keep on finding myself going back for more. What is Project Euler you might ask? In their own words...




> 
  
> 
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

I've only done the first 4 problems so far so I haven't even reached "level 1" according to their scoring yet. Nothing has been all that challenging up to this point, the problems have been taking me around 30-60 minutes to solve. It's just nice to have a pool of simple programming problems that one can go back to when one is in the mood, sort of like having a book of logic problems laying around.
