Spending a week in [Kahana](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kahana+Beach,+Lahaina,+Maui,+Hawaii+96761&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&hl=en&sll=20.892642,-156.505225&sspn=0.22627,0.41592&cd=6&geocode=FaoPQAEdKkqp9g&ll=21.097313,-156.788635&spn=0.493274,1.216736&z=10&iwloc=addr) with my parents, my 3 younger brothers, and my younger brother's family. Its my first time to hawaii, what are my quick first impressions?





  
  * I'll take 80-85 degree weather over 30-40 degree weather anyday, cloudy or not.


  
  * Things in Maui are pricey - gas is about $1 more a gallon than back home, food ranges from slightly to extremely more expensive.


  
  * Some areas of Hawaii remind me of pictures I've seen of the moon, or ones sent back by the Mars lander, others remind me more of eastern washington. I've only seen a bit of land so far that reminds me of [Jurassic Park](http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1755)


  
  * Walking through [Lahaina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahaina), most of it seems really touristy. I've never seen so many people trying to sell you time shares clustered together in like a 5 block radius before.


  
  * Little kids like to get up early. really early.
