What did we wake up to this morning?

Yep, total downpour, pretty much all day long. O'ahu took the brunt of the storm, getting 14(!) inches of rain in less than 24 hours. Maui didn't get it as bad, but it got a whole bunch of rain. The 5 day forecast isn't looking too hot either - laugh it up all you haters, bitter that I'm in Hawaii and you're not :P. We're not letting it hold us back though. Today we took the [drive out to Hana](http://www.mauiinformationguide.com/road-to-hana.php) anyways and we have more plans for the rest of the time here. Yesterday was actually really nice, perfect to drive up to over 10,000 ft and check out [Haleakala.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakala)
