Well, I'm not sure what is up with weather forecasting for the Maui area, but pretty much the only trend I can extract is that when they call for rain all day, its going to be gorgeous and 90+ degrees while if they call for a slight chance of rain, that means downpours for sure.




How have we been keeping ourselves entertained you might ask?





  
  * Went and checked out the sharks, turtles, and other fish at the [Maui Ocean Center](http://www.mauioceancenter.com/) . They also put on a bit of a show where they put a diver into a big old tank to feed the fish and allow you to do a bit of a Q&A with the marine biologists.


  
  * Drove though Kihei down south to check out the lava fields and do a bit of snorkeling, ended up doubling back and spending the afternoon at the delightful [Big Beach](http://www.mauibeachguide.com/Big_Beach.html) .


  
  * Saw a fantastic magic show over at [Warren & Annabelle's](http://warrenandannabelles.com/) .


  
  * Went on an nice day hike up the [Waile'e Valley](http://gohawaii.about.com/od/mauiland/ss/waihee_hike_3.htm), along a river and over a couple of suspension bridges, up to a waterfall. Apparently Lost [filmed some scenes](http://www.lostvirtualtour.com/lost/filming_locations/waiheevalley/index.html) up here.


  
  * Had a late lunch in [Paia](http://www.paiamaui.com/) and ended up spending the afternoon at the [Paia Bay Beach](http://www.paiamaui.com/Beaches.htm) .




After seeing the [weather reports](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008513042_weather14m.html) from back home I am *not* looking forward to going home tomorrow.
