I've been working a lot on my flashcard application behind the scenes lately doing things like switching over to [cocoa bindings](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html), messing around with UI, adding little features here and there. I went through a drawer phase for a while but thankfully regained my senses and ripped them all out.

I went ahead and cleaned up the code enough that I'm not *totally* embarssed for other people to check it out so I [added a page](http://alexrose.net/?page_id=83) dedicated to the application as part of my wordpress site and [added the source code](http://code.assembla.com/cerebralimprint/subversion/nodes) to a free subversion hosting service (www.assembla.com).
