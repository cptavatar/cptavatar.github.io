It's that time of year again. Ahh, [SIFF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_International_Film_Festival) - how I love thee so. Last night I was convinced to go to the midnight showing of the campy Norwegian nazi zombie flick, [Dead Snow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278340/). Perhaps not a film classic, but a nice mix of humor and abundant intestines.




As usual, you can check out the films over on the [SIFF site](http://www.siff.net/) or over at the [Stranger guide](http://www.thestranger.com/siff) - nice twist, this year you can download an [iPhone app](http://www.siff.net/mobile/) too.
