I've been playing around with git for a while now for my own projects and thought I'd give a couple of quickie shout outs to some useful sites & tools. Via total coincidence, turns out they are both from \*[Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) even though I came to them independently.

First of all, after you download the [command line tools](http://git-scm.com/download) and start to get [familiar](http://help.github.com/git-cheat-sheets/) with them if you're like me you also want a graphical tool in your pocket. If you're just messing around you might not want drop a lot (or any) cash either on something like [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) either. If thats the case, I've found [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) works decently, looks nice, and is the right price (free). Too bad I grabbed it from the App Store, looks like there are some [issues with the upcoming restrictions](http://blog.sourcetreeapp.com/2012/02/16/abandoning-the-mac-app-store/) there and you'll have to grab it straight from their site instead.

Next, you might want somewhere external to host. Of course everyone has heard of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and thats great if you have a few open source projects you would like to share, but what if you just want something for your personal stuff? GitHub wants [$7/mo minimum](https://github.com/plans) in this case  but for up to 5 collaborators, BitBucket gives you [unlimited repos for free](https://bitbucket.org/plans). Nice!



\*Atlassian: I still wish you hadn't removed wiki markup from [Confluence](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2011/11/why-we-removed-wiki-markup-editor-in-confluence-4/) ...grrr
