After the update to 12.04 for my ubuntu-based file server went awry, I took another look at the FreeBSD based [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org/) as a replacement. Turns out it was pretty easy to set up and I'm digging how it runs

The Good:



	
  * [ZFS](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19963-01/html/821-1448/gaypw.html). Pools! Snapshots! RaidZ! Doesn't take that much reading to get dangerous.

	
  * Time Machine. Works well with Lion even, was having problems with ubuntu before where it was a hassle to get working.

	
  * You install on a flashdrive, leaves your ports open just for storage.


The not so good:

	
  * Miss my print sharing, the only other feature I was using from running a full server distro. [8.2](http://doc.freenas.org/index.php/What%27s_New_in_8.2) maybe?

	
  * The piece of @#$@# Asus motherboard I'm using doesn't like to boot automatically off the flash drive, I need to select it each time on restart or it hangs due to a bug. Good think I don't restart often, thats ridiculous.




I did run into a couple of other problems. Trying to copy data back to the server I got these pesky Error - 50 messages that would abort the copy over AFP. Turns out from looking at the logs, I had a number of  .AppleDouble files I needed to delete first to get the copy  using a



    
    find . -d -name .AppleDouble -exec rm -rf '{}' \;







I also have a few scripts that use rsync to copy data around on a regular basis and need to use key based authentication with SSH however for that was giving me woes at first as well. Turns out looking at the logs I need to go back and make sure the permissions and ownership of all the mount directories ([something like this](http://fuzzysword.blogspot.com/2010/02/login-to-freenas-via-passwordless-ssh.html)) were correct otherwise SSHD gets grumpy.
